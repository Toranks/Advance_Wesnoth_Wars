# Changelog

For more clarity about compatibility, first 2 version numbers will follow base game version.

So 1.14.X.Y means game was checked compatible with Wesnoth 1.14. X is incremented for new features ; Y is increment for fixes/optimisations.

## [1.16.0] - 2019-10-19	

### Added	
- Messages with portrait of the character that levels up and receives an AMLA bonus (english and spanish, but not french)
- Spanish translation (complete)

### Changed
- Epic trait now doesn't increases attack hits by 20%, only attack damage
- All stat bonuses now are [object] for better compatibility between maps
- AI gets 2*X (double) passive experience if you activates the feature, for balancing
- Level up increases (10*X)% (+10%, +20%, etc.) max experience (requires for next level) if you activates AMLA number increase feature, AMLA bonus, and passive experience together, in addition to the +20% increase by default, for balancing
X = passive experience value you selected


### Fixed
- Fixed some typos on the code, the included on RusackN1 fork and some others
- Max movement points bonus now preserved between maps
- When AMLA number increase feature is active the level is preserved when the unit is rebuilt for any reason (for example when a temporary [object] as bloodthirsty or potions is removed from the unit)
- Prevent Injured Sergeant to level-up by gaining passive xp (Campaigns)

#### Note:	
I don't recommend to use the non-random combat feature because it doesn't detect the changes between night/day and other defenses/special bonuses well. Instead, Biased RNG from the base game is a perfect substitute.
