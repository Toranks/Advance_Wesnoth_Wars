### Special pickable weapons/items Macros
# Author: Ruvaak
# Original Creation
# Used in scenarios/4p_Ruvaak_Mirage_Atoll.cfg

## macro based on core OBJ_STORM, with changed damages/strikes and not usable only by merfolk. vanilla weapon is 14x2
# TODO fix a bug where an unit with same name can pick it not being where the trident is, after wearer is killed by debug or an unit,
# ,  sometimes saying after "cannot use" sometime empty unit selected. Meanwhile the original location keep the picture, but trident is not here.
